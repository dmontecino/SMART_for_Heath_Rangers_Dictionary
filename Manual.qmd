# Manual SMART for Health - Rangers {.unnumbered}

Version 1.3.0 July, 2024

This manual describes SMART for Health for Rangers Collecting Specimens and explains its proper use.

The current manual applies to SMART version 7. For more information about the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) please visit https://smartconservationtools.org/. To learn more about how to use SMART Desktop and Connect please visit https://smartconservationtools.org/.

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) is an approach originally designed to support law enforcement in protected areas. SMART provides a set of technological tools: SMART Desktop, SMART Mobile, and SMART Connect. SMART Mobile is a smartphone app that supports smooth and standardized data collection in the field, keeps track of the spatiotemporal coordinates of the users and of the data being collected, allows the collection of image and audio data in the field, and allows real-time communication of data to out-of-the-field focal points through SMART Connect when internet connection is available. This real-time connection provides the opportunity to promptly react to detected events.

The WCS -- Health Program has created a SMART data model to track wildlife health events and the specimens collected from these events (SMART for Health). This data model can be extended as a "SMART Patrol Package" and installed in the SMART Mobile app to support the collection of information from these events (e.g., wildlife mass mortalities or surveillance activities in wet markets). Here we describe how a portion of the SMART for Health data model can be used by rangers using SMART Mobile to record their observations of dead, sick, or injured wildlife and track the specimens collected when these animals are found. The purpose of this manual is to explain ranger use of SMART for Health in the field; therefore, the manual **does not explain** how to install SMART Desktop, Mobile, or Connect or how to load SMART for Health in the mobile devices.

In this manual, we capitalize nouns such as **Attributes, Categories, Incidents**, and others when they refer to SMART components.

## SMART Data Structure

A summary of the data structure in SMART is provided below.

SMART Incidents within a SMART Patrol:

Starting at the bottom of either approach, SMART for Health facilitates the collection of field observations (**SMART Observations**) to describe the categories of information that compose a **Wildlife Health Event**. These **Events** are recorded as rangers find **dead, sick, or injured animals during their** **patrols.**

### SMART Patrol

A **SMART Patrol** is the period during which rangers are patrolling the protected areas and record data using SMART Mobile. A Patrol is initiated by clicking the "Start Patrol" button and once the information requested in the "Start Patrol" screen is completed (see SMART Manual).

### SMART Incident

A **SMART Incident** is a set of observations made in the field at the same spatiotemporal location. For example, rangers patrolling a protected area find carcasses of wild boars. The wild boars represent an Event of interest to be recorded.

### SMART Observation

A **SMART Observation** is a specific class of information within a **SMART Incident**. Each Observation can relate specifically to the characteristics of the environment, the species observed, the type of individuals sampled, or the samples collected.

**SMART Observations are added to a SMART Incident using SMART Categories**. An Observation is added by completing a SMART Category.

**SMART Observations** of each **SMART Incident** are saved as a unique packages of information at the same specific time and location.

### SMART Category

A **SMART Category** is a set of **SMART Attributes** that request information about a specific category of information within a Wildlife Health Event.

### SMART Attribute

When a SMART Category is selected, a set of fields are displayed on the screen corresponding to specific data items requested within a Category. Each one of them is a SMART Attribute. Attributes are mandatory or optional. Mandatory Attributes are identified with a grey asterisk and they are required to complete the collection of the SMART Observation. Mandatory Attributes with missing information will turn red if the check mark symbol on the top-right is clicked on.

### SMART Attribute and Sub-Attribute Options

Attribute Options are the preset choices used to answer an Attribute or Sub-Attribute.

## Wildlife Health Event

A **Wildlife Health Event** is a discrete spatiotemporal set of field findings that are relevant for the goals of wildlife health surveillance. **A standalone group of healthy animals is not a Wildlife Health Event**. **However, when rangers find a group of dead, sick, or injured animals, the healthy animals present nearby are important to document.**

A Wildlife Health Event for rangers is defined as "the presence of at least one observably unhealthy animal (sick, injured, or dead), irrespective of the cause, at a specific location and point in time, along with all other 'healthy' animals and potentially relevant environmental features at the same specific spatiotemporal location. The animals can be wild or domestic and free-ranging, hunted, or captive".

Wildlife Health Event examples include: (1) a group of dead, sick, and healthy waterfowl on the shore of a pond, (2) the identification of poisoned carnivores, and (3) an injured herbivore.

## Wildlife Health Events in SMART

A **Wildlife Health Event (see below) is documented as a SMART Incident** within a **SMART Patrol**. A Wildlife Health Event is recorded by collecting **SMART Observations** through the completion of **SMART Categories** and their SMART Attributes available in the referential **SMART for Health Patrol Package** for **SMART Mobile**. In the case of the **referential** **SMART for Health** patrol package, the SMART Categories are "Site Description", "Wildlife", "Livestock - Domestic Species", and "Animal and Samples".

The diagram below shows the referential **SMART Categories** of information to record Wildlife Health Events and their hierarchy.

The **SMART Categories in the referential SMART for Health** in **SMART Mobile** look loke this:

### Description of the SMART Categories in SMART for Health

#### General Information (Event level)

This Category is used to collect information about environmental damage where the Wildlife Health Event is observed if any.

#### Wildlife (Species level)

This Category is used to describe wildlife species at the Wildlife Health Event. This Category should be use once per species observed per Event. For example, if three species of waterfowl are observed in a Wildlife Health Event, this Category should be used three times to document the species involved in the Event (once per species).

#### Livestock -- Domestic Species (Species level)

This Category is used to describe all domestic animals observed. This Category should be used once per domestic species observed in a Wildlife Health Event.

#### Animal and Samples (Individual animal level and its samples)

This Category describes specific individual animals belonging to any of the species documented for the Wildlife Health Event and the samples collected from them. in the case of rangers, individual level data are collected only from those animals providing samples.

In summary, the figure below shows how Observations of a Wildlife Health Event are collected as a **SMART Incident**.

The description of Attributes, Sub-Attributes, and Options across the Categories used in SMART for Health is provided in the data dictionary accessible [here](https://dmontecino.github.io/SMART_for_Heath_Rangers_Dictionary/).

## Using SMART for Health

The following section explains how to use the referential SMART for Health patrol package to record Wildlife Health Events. Once a Wildlife Health Event is detected during a patrol, the SMART for Health user should click on the "Incident" button of the Patrol screen.

To document a Wildlife Health Event, SMART for Health users add Observations using the different Categories.

1.  **Click on the \"Make Observation\"** option of the \"Incident\" screen. Selecting this option opens the menu of Categories:
